\title{String concatenation operator with expression evaluation}
\usage{
s1 \%+\% s2
}
\arguments{
\item{s1}{First string or expression to concatenate}

\item{s2}{Second string or expression to concatenate}
}
\value{
A character string containing the concatenated result
}
\description{
This infix operator concatenates two strings after evaluating any expressions
in the arguments. It's useful for building strings that include computed values.
}
\details{
The operator evaluates both arguments as expressions before converting them
to characters and concatenating. This allows for dynamic string construction
with computed values.
}
\note{
This operator is not exported by default as it may conflict with
ggplot2's \%+\% operator. Use matsunoR::\verb{\%+\%} if needed when both packages are loaded.
}
\examples{
# Basic string concatenation
"Hello" \%+\% " World"  # Returns "Hello World"

# With expression evaluation
(1 + 2) \%+\% " units"  # Returns "3 units"

# With variables
x <- 5
y <- 10
"Result: " \%+\% (x + y)  # Returns "Result: 15"

# Multiple concatenations
"Value " \%+\% x \%+\% " is " \%+\% (x > 3)  # Returns "Value 5 is TRUE"

}
