\title{Create a balanced panel dataset}
\usage{
create_panel(N, Time, J = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Number of firms (cross-sectional units).}

\item{Time}{Integer. Number of time periods.}

\item{J}{Integer. Number of groups (industries). Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\item{i}{Firm identifier (1 to N)}
\item{t}{Time period identifier (1 to Time)}
\item{j}{Group identifier (1 to J), only included if J > 1}
}
\description{
This function creates a balanced panel dataset with specified numbers of firms,
time periods, and optionally groups (industries). All firms are observed in
all time periods.
}
\details{
The function creates a balanced panel where every firm appears in every time period.
When J > 1, the panel is replicated for each group, creating J separate groups
of N firms each observed over Time periods.
}
\examples{
# Create a simple panel with 3 firms over 4 time periods
panel_simple <- create_panel(N = 3, Time = 4)
head(panel_simple)

# Create a panel with 2 firms, 3 time periods, and 2 groups
panel_groups <- create_panel(N = 2, Time = 3, J = 2)
head(panel_groups)

# Check the structure
nrow(panel_groups)  # Should be 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 observations

}
