\title{Install or Update OpenBLAS for R on Windows via PowerShell Elevation}
\usage{
update_openblas_windows(verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints status messages. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns TRUE on success (PowerShell command sent),
FALSE or stops on failure before attempting elevation. Note that
success here means the elevation prompt was likely shown; it doesn't
guarantee the user approved it or that the copy succeeded within
the elevated process.
}
\description{
Downloads the latest x64 OpenBLAS release from GitHub, extracts
libopenblas.dll, renames copies to Rblas.dll and Rlapack.dll,
and uses an elevated PowerShell prompt (UAC) to replace the
existing DLLs in the current R installation's bin/x64 directory.
}
\details{
Requires an internet connection and the 'httr', 'jsonlite', and 'base64enc'
packages. This function will trigger a Windows User Account Control (UAC)
prompt requesting administrator privileges to modify files in the R
installation directory.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run this in a standard (non-admin) R session.
# It will trigger a UAC prompt for elevation.
update_openblas_windows()

# After running, restart R and check sessionInfo()
}
}
