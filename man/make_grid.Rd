\title{Generate a grid of values, optionally concentrating around one or more points.}
\usage{
make_grid(
  min_val,
  max_val,
  length = 100,
  concentration_points = NULL,
  strength = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{min_val}{Numeric scalar.  Lower bound of the grid.}

\item{max_val}{Numeric scalar.  Upper bound of the grid.}

\item{length}{Integer.  Number of points in the returned grid.  Default 100.}

\item{concentration_points}{Numeric vector of values in \link{min_val, max_val}
where the grid should cluster.  Default NULL.}

\item{strength}{Numeric scalar ≥ 0.  Height of the Gaussians at each
concentration point, relative to the uniform baseline.  Larger → more pull.
Default 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{length}.
}
\description{
If \code{concentration_points} is NULL or empty, returns an even grid.
Otherwise we build a simple mixture density: 1 everywhere plus Gaussian bumps
at each concentration point (bandwidth = 10\% of the total range),
with relative height given by \code{strength}.  We then warp the uniform grid
by the CDF of that density so points cluster around the specified values.

\examples{
# Set up parameters
min_val <- -1
max_val <- 5
length  <- 100

# Uniform grid
grid_uniform <- make_grid(min_val, max_val, length)

# Grid concentrated around 2 and 4
grid_2_4 <- make_grid(
  min_val,
  max_val,
  length,
  concentration_points = c(2, 4),
  strength = 5
)

# Plotting the grids in separate panels
par(mfrow = c(2, 1), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1))

# Uniform grid
plot(
  grid_uniform, rep(1, length),
  type = "b", xlim = c(min_val, max_val),
  xlab = "Grid Values", ylab = "",
  main = "Uniform Grid"
)
grid()

# Grid concentrated around 2 and 4
